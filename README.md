## Pro pitch: 
Hey my name is Patrick Kawika Reveira. Before changing career paths I was a Real Estate Agent and also spent 5 years as an IT in the US Coast Guard. Although I have extensive knowledge of Real Estate, my true superpower is my positive growth mindset. I made the switch to Software Development Engineering because I can see the opportunities available for those in this industry. I strive to create a life for my wife and daughter that is superior to the life I was afforded growing up, to honor all the hard work and dedication my parents gave for me. I am hoping to find a role in Full-Stack Development for a great company that aligns with my growth mindset. My military experience has made me a great leader but it has also taught me how to be a great follower as well. Giving me a great advantage as an individual working either alone or leading teams, while cementing in me the ability to effectively work with others in team environments.

**What excites me the most about tech is its ability to continuously innovate and transform the way we live, work, and interact with the world, pushing the boundaries of what's possible and enhancing our capabilities in unimaginable ways. Additionally, the prospect of solving complex problems and addressing global challenges through technological advancements fills me with anticipation and hope for a better future.**
